<h1 align="center"><b>API-TS-PRISMA</b></h1>

<p>Here you'll find a REST API built with Node.js, TypeScript, and the Prisma ORM, using MySQL as the database. In this project, I've leveraged Design Patterns to ensure a robust and scalable architecture. I'm excited to share with you an efficient and high-quality solution. Please refer to this README.md file for some details and instructions on how to use this API. Feel free to explore and provide feedback. I hope you enjoy my work!</p>

<h2><b>Design Patterns</b></h2>

<p>
Design patterns are reusable solutions for common software design problems. They are code structuring patterns that help organize and improve the maintainability, flexibility, and extensibility of a system, promoting good development practices. Design patterns are based on previous experiences and provide tried-and-true approaches to solving recurring challenges in software construction.</p>
